# Emergency-Gesture

# 🤖 Gesture – Smart Safety Alert System

## 📘 Overview
**Gesture** is a backend-only Python project that uses computer vision to recognize specific hand gestures captured through a camera.  
Based on the detected gesture, it automatically sends predefined **alert messages via email** to designated contacts — such as family members, hospitals, or police — indicating whether the person is *safe* or *in danger*.

This system can be useful for emergency situations (for example, when the phone is out of reach) and works entirely through **real-time gesture recognition**.
